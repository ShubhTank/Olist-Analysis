## üí° Key Insights & Findings

* **Geographic Concentration:** The majority of revenue is generated from the Southeast region of Brazil, suggesting a strong market presence that could be replicated in other regions.
* **Impact of Delivery Time on Reviews:** A strong negative correlation was found between late deliveries and low customer review scores (1 or 2 stars). Reducing delivery time by even one day can significantly boost customer satisfaction.
* **Top Performing Categories:** Categories like `Bed, Bath & Table`, `Health & Beauty`, and `Sports & Leisure` are the primary revenue drivers.
* **Seasonal Peaks:** Identified major sales peaks around November (Black Friday) and May, indicating key periods for targeted marketing campaigns.
